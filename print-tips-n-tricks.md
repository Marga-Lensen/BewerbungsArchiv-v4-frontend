Nice, congrats on reaching that solid milestone! ðŸŽ‰ Having your frontend talk cleanly to your backend and showing your actual job apps in a table is a great foundation.

For the **printing and exporting UX** you want, here are some practical tips and options to polish it nicely:

---

### 1. **Printing the table well**

* **Use a dedicated print stylesheet** (CSS with `@media print`):

  * Hide all non-essential UI elements (navbars, buttons, inputs)
  * Make fonts readable and adjust spacing for print
  * Force table width to fit on one page width (`max-width: 100%;` and `table-layout: fixed`)
  * Use page breaks wisely, e.g. `page-break-inside: avoid;` on rows or sections

* Example snippet:

```css
@media print {
  body * {
    visibility: hidden;
  }
  #printable-table, #printable-table * {
    visibility: visible;
  }
  #printable-table {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    table-layout: fixed;
    word-wrap: break-word;
  }
  /* hide buttons and navigation, if any */
  button, nav, .no-print {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

* Add a **Print button** that calls `window.print()` for easy access.

### 2. **Print Preview**

* The browserâ€™s native print preview is usually sufficient.
* If you want an **in-app preview**, youâ€™d need to create a modal or separate page with a clean, print-ready version of the table.
* But often just styling with `@media print` + `window.print()` works well.

---

### 3. **Export options**

* **Export to JSON**: straightforward, just `JSON.stringify(data)` and download a `.json` file.
* **Export to Markdown**: can be done by converting table data into markdown table syntax and downloading as `.md`.
* **Export to PDF**:

  * Use libraries like [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) or [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org/)
  * Or use `html2canvas` + `jsPDF` to capture the table as an image in the PDF.
  * This is a bit more involved but gives a professional touch.

### 4. **Other tips**

* **Responsive table**: make sure itâ€™s scrollable horizontally on smaller screens but fits on print.
* **Fonts**: use print-safe fonts.
* **Colors**: reduce or simplify colors for better print clarity.
* **Page orientation**: suggest landscape in print dialog (CSS `@page { size: landscape; }` but browser support varies).

* Print-friendly table with `@media print`
* JSON / Markdown export buttons and logic
* PDF export starter code using jsPDF
